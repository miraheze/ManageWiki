# Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any part of our code, please do not post it publicly by using our wikis or bug trackers for that; rather, please read our [security page](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Security) carefully, and follow the instructions.

As a quick overview, you can email security concerns to security@miraheze.org which will open a phabricator task that is hidden from public view. If you'd like, you can instead directly create a security-related task [here](https://phabricator.miraheze.org/maniphest/task/edit/form/2/), but please leave the "Security" project on the issue.
